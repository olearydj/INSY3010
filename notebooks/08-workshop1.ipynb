    "# Python Coding Workshop - Unit 1\n",
    "\n",
    "This unit covers everything up thru and including loops and conditionals. Here is a concise summary of the Python skills you should be comfortable applying:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Types and Variables\n",
    "- Understand Python's basic data types (int, float, str, bool, None)\n",
    "- Create and name variables following Python conventions\n",
    "- Understand variable assignment and reassignment\n",
    "- Recognize the difference between expressions and statements\n",
    "- Know the rules for legal variable names\n",
    "- Understand Python's keywords (e.g. class) and why they can't be used as variable names\n",
    "\n",
    "Numbers and Math\n",
    "- Use basic arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, //, %)\n",
    "- Apply the correct order of operations (PEMDAS)\n",
    "- Use exponentiation (**) correctly\n",
    "- Convert between data types (int(), float(), str())\n",
    "- Import and use functions from the math module\n",
    "- Round numbers using the round() function\n",
    "\n",
    "Strings\n",
    "- Create string literals using quotes (' ' or \" \")\n",
    "- Concatenate strings with the + operator\n",
    "- Repeat strings with the * operator\n",
    "- Access characters using indexing (both positive and negative indices)\n",
    "- Extract substrings using slicing with start, stop, stride\n",
    "- Use common string methods (lower(), upper(), split(), etc.)\n",
    "- Format strings using f-strings with precision formatting (e.g. {expr:.2f})\n",
    "- Determine string length with len()\n",
    "- Understand string immutability\n",
    "\n",
    "Input and Output\n",
    "- Get user input with input() including optional prompt\n",

    "- Create multi-line output with proper formatting\n",
    "- Use escape sequences (\\n, \\t) for formatting\n",
    "- Format numbers with specific decimal places in output using f-strings\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists\n",
    "- Create and initialize lists\n",

    "- Use list methods (append(), insert(), remove(), pop(), etc.)\n",
    "- Measure list length with len()\n",
    "- Use list slicing to create new lists\n",
    "- Use the in operator to check for membership in sequences\n",
    "- Understand list concatenation and repetition\n",
    "- Process lists using loops\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional Statements\n",
    "- Write simple if statements\n",

    "- Use the in operator in conditions\n",
    "- Write nested conditionals when appropriate\n",
    "- Simplify nested conditionals using compound conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "Loops\n",
    "- Create while loops with appropriate conditions\n",
    "- Implement counter-controlled loops\n",
    "- Use for loops to iterate through sequences\n",
    "- Create loops with range() with different parameters\n",
    "- Use break to exit loops early\n",
    "- Use continue to skip iterations\n",
    "- Avoid infinite loops\n",
    "- Implement common loop patterns: \n",
    "  - Counting items\n",
    "  - Computing sums/averages\n",
    "  - Finding maximum/minimum values\n",
    "  - Building lists\n",
    "  - Modifying sequences\n",
    "\n",
    "Modules and Functions\n",
    "- Import modules (import math)\n",
    "- Use module functions (math.sqrt(), math.pi)\n",
    "- Use built-in functions (print(), input(), len(), etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The following sections provide example problems suitable for assessing your ability to apply those skills."
