    "The Auburn Distribution Center operates 24 hours a day with three shifts. The first shift (morning) runs from 6:00 AM to 2:00 PM, the second shift (afternoon) operates from 2:00 PM to 10:00 PM, and the third shift (night) covers 10:00 PM to 6:00 AM. \n",

    "Each shift requires different staffing levels based on expected order volume. The morning shift processes 40% of daily orders, afternoon handles 35%, and night processes the remaining 25%. Workers can process 50 packages per hour on average, though this varies by Â±10% based on package complexity.\n",

    "Management wants to determine minimum staffing requirements for each shift given a daily order target. However, there are constraints: each shift must have at least 3 workers for safety reasons, and the total workforce cannot exceed 50 people due to facility limitations. Additionally, workers are paid different rates: morning shift workers earn \\\\$18/hour, afternoon workers earn \\\\$20/hour (includes a 11.1% shift differential), and night workers earn \\\\$24/hour (includes a 33.3% shift differential for overnight work).\n",
