    "* **Syntax error**: \"Syntax\" refers to the structure of a program and the rules about that structure. If there is a syntax error anywhere in your program, Python does not run the program. It displays an error message immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Runtime error**: If there are no syntax errors in your program, it can start running. But if something goes wrong, Python displays an error message and stops. This type of error is called a runtime error. It is also called an **exception** because it indicates that something exceptional has happened.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Semantic error** (aka *logic* error): The third type of error is \"semantic\", which means related to meaning. If there is a semantic error in your program, it runs without generating error messages, but it does not do what you intended. Identifying semantic errors can be tricky because it requires you to work backward by looking at the output of the program and trying to figure out what it is doing."
