    "> As a warehouse operations manager during the holiday shipping season, you need to assign delivery trucks to loading docks for their scheduled shipments. You have a list of truck arrivals, sorted by cargo volume (largest to smallest), with each truck's preferred loading time window. You also have a list of available loading docks of different sizes and their time slot availabilities. Each dock can only handle trucks up to its size limit (based on dock height and space), and you can assign up to three different trucks to use a dock throughout the day (morning, afternoon, evening windows). Your task is to assign each truck to an appropriate dock based on the truck's size, the dock's capacity, and the availability of the dock during their preferred time window. Report any unassigned trucks at the end of the process, as they will need to be redirected to overflow facilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Truck Queue: You have a list of truck arrivals sorted by cargo volume (largest first), each with a preferred time window\n",
    "2. Dock Constraints: Each dock has a maximum truck size it can accommodate and three possible time windows per day\n",
    "3. Time Windows: Each truck needs one window (morning, afternoon, or evening)\n",
    "4. Daily Assignments: Each dock can serve up to three different trucks per day (one per window)\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume that time windows are standardized, so a simple comparison is sufficient to check compatibility. If you find you need to make other assumptions, include comments to describe them with your submission.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your submission should represent a plan for assigning trucks to docks, not for developing a software program. As such, it should not use Python functions, operators, etc. Describe the human actions and decisions necessary to complete this task. Be sure to use keywords and indentation, along with the other style conventions discussed in class. Your submission should be detailed enough to take at least 10 lines, but abstract enough that it doesn't take more than 15."
